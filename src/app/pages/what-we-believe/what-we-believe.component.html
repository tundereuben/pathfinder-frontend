      <h3 class="text-center">STATEMENT OF FAITH </h3>
      <p class="lead text-muted text-justify">Our belief system is founded on the doctrine of Sola Scriptura (The Bible alone), meaning the Bible is the sole source of revelation and the only and final authority in all matters of the Christian faith. </p>

        <li> <h5 class="text-danger">The Bible </h5>
          We affirm that the Bible, made up of 66 books, is inspired and inerrant Word of God. We also teach the authority of Scriptures as the basis for Christian doctrines, morals, and practice (2 Timothy 3: 15 - 17; 2 Peter 1: 20 - 21). </li>

        <li><h5 class="text-danger">Jesus Christ </h5>
          We believe Jesus Christ is God Who came in human flesh through virgin birth, lived a perfectly sinless life, died for the atonement, rose bodily from dead, ascended to heaven, and will personally return to judge mankind as according to their works (John 1: 1 - 3, 14; Philippians 2: 5 - 8; Hebrew 1: 1 - 3; 1 John 5: 11 - 12). </li>

        <li><h5 class="text-danger">The Holy Spirit</h5>
          We teach that the Holy Spirit is the third person of the Godhead. He is a person. The Holy Spirit is the One Who recreates believers in Christ and indwells them as a mark of divine ownership. Through Him, born-again believers are empowered to experience practical victory over sin, Satan, and the world. Anyone who is not indwelt by the Holy Spirit is not a child of God (John14: 6; Acts 1: 5,8; 1 Corinthians 6: 19 - 20; Ephesians 1: 13 - 14). </li>

        <li><h5 class="text-danger">The Depravity of Man</h5>
          We know that man is eternally damned as a result of Adam's sin. Also, man is inwardly corrupt and inclined to live a life of sin. He is without hope and God, except he comes back to God in repentance and accepts God's grace through faith in the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ (Genesis 3; Jeremiah 17: 9; Romans 3: 10 - 18, 23; 5: 12). </li>

        <li><h5 class="text-danger">Salvation</h5>
          We believe and teach that salvation is God's free gift to every human. Through faith in the finished work of Christ, man is saved by the grace of God. Jesus Christ is the only way to God, through which man experiences pardon for sin, justification, and recreation. All who believe that Jesus Christ died for their sins and rose from the dead shall be saved. Believers in Christ do not live a life of sin as an evidence of the inner works of the Holy Spirit (John 3: 16; Acts 4: 12; Romans 3: 23; 6: 23; 10: 9 – 12; Eph. 2: 1 – 9). </li>

        <li><h5 class="text-danger">Marriage </h5>
          We teach that the original of God Who instituted marriage is that it should be a union between two adults of opposite sexes (male and female). Marriage is intended for a lifetime, except where couples are separated by death. The Bible prohibits the marriage of a believer in Christ to an unsaved person. Also, it is written in the Bible that remarriage is forbidden while one's first companion is still alive (Gen. 2: 18 – 24; Mal. 13 – 16; Mat. 19: 1 – 9; 2 Cor. 6: 14 – 16).
